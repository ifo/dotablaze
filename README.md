dotablaze
=========

dotablaze is [Dota 2](http://blog.dota2.com/) api reader.
It displays a tiny amount of information about all live Dota 2 games.

Presently, that tiny amount of information is:
- match ID
- match duration
- radiant tower status number
- dire tower status number

[Here's how you find out what the tower status number means]

#### Why such a tiny amount of information?

dotablaze is a prototype.
It may be completed in the future, but for now it just needs to display **some**
information.
Adding more information is not difficult, but it is out of scope for the current
needs of this project.
